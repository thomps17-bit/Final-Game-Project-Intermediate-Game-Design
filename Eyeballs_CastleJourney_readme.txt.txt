Start on the Main Menu Scene.

WASD keys to move around, use mouse to change viewpoint, Space to jump(Bugged) / Run into jewels to collect them and make progress.

Jewels serve as collectibles, there is an enemy that will follow you, there is a working health system, main menu screen, respawn system, and game over screen. Running off ledge will cause you to lose health and respawn. Losing all health will cause game over.

Bugs:

Jump does not work properly.

Enemy running into player can cause physics issues.

Quit Game and Restart buttons do not work.
